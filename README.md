# OTHER CHARTS THAT WERENT CREDITED IS CHARTED BY THE OFFICIAL DEVS AND SOME CHARTS ARE MODDED BY ME (realbrongfield) TO FIX GLITCHED NOTES (glitched notes are notes that when pressed gives score and rating but still scrolls until missed) (also some of these glitched notes might still not be patched)

also some notes if you're playing the game:
1. if you go to story menu and want to access douyhe week there, all you have to type is "helikestotalkaboutitanditshisfavoritethingever" exactly.
2. if you want to play bleeding song in story mode, all you have to do is play cool difficulty.
3. bonus functionality is in the pause menu for songs including a not so hidden secret of story mode bsides and a button to literally turn your pc off.
4. to access antipiracy song, press "a" on the title screen (before main menu) and spam any key or multiple keys until you get to the loading screen.
5. while on title screen, if you press "s", you can skip the warnings and disclaimers.
6. the oh-god-oh-fuck song is old antipiracy from the demo's old builds in source code.
7. there are actually a couple of demo-only things, all of which (everything other than dialogue), i've ported over to the main build for a complete experience of ron 2.5.
8. to access bsides in main freeplay, just keep scrolling difficulties until you reach flip difficulty.
9. to access bleeding in main freeplay, just use cool difficulty and scroll to where bloodshed would be on any other difficulty (to where bloodshed-b would be in flip aswell).
